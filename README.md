## **Project Overview**

Loan approval prediction is a classic classification problem in finance. The model predicts the likelihood of a loan being approved based on applicant details such as income, credit history, employment status, and property area.

**Key Features:**
- Data preprocessing: missing value handling, categorical encoding, scaling
- Feature engineering: one-hot encoding for categorical features
- Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Ensemble method: Soft Voting Classifier
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix
- Feature importance visualization
- Save/load trained model for predictions
